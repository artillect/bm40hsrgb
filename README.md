# KPRepublic BM40

This layout is based on QMK's default layout for the BM40. This keyboard is my daily driver, I mostly game and do general computer tasks, but I also do some graphic design and coding. I navigate my computer using mouse and keyboard, but there is also a navigation layer for mouseless use of the computer.

## Changes from default (roughly in order of priority):
- Numbers are on lower, and symbols are on raise. Being able to access numbers in-game is a must for me, so I moved the numbers to the lower layer so I can access them with my left hand.
- Home-row modifiers (https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
- Gaming layer (ADJUST + G). Disables mod-taps and nav layer to prevent keyboard shortcuts from being set off while playing games.
- Numpad layer (ADJUST + N)


## WIP:
- Greek/scientific/math layer
- International layer
- Considering switching navigation layer to a vim layer
