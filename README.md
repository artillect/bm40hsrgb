(The way it looked when it came to me, after I moved some things around)

_Revision 3.0_

This layout is based on QMK's default layout for the BM40. 
This keyboard is my daily driver:
  - I do general computer tasks.
  - I play a lot of games (with both mouse and keyboard and without, mostly first-person (Call of Duty; Overwatch) or top-down strategy games (Starcraft; League of Legends) 
  - I also do graphic design, industrial design, and marketing for the Milton S. Eisenhower symposium.
  - I navigate my computer using mouse and keyboard, but there is also a navigation layer for mouseless use of the computer. _This is really useful while on vacation!_
  - Each layer is included with a purpose, if it doesn't work, I probably don't need it right now

## Changes from default (roughly in order of priority):
- Numbers are on lower, and symbols are on raise. Being able to access numbers in-game is a must for me, so I moved the numbers to the lower layer so I can access them with my left hand.
- Home-row modifiers (https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
- Gaming layer (ADJUST + G). Disables mod-taps and nav layer to prevent keyboard shortcuts from being set off while playing games.
- Numpad layer (ADJUST + N)


## WIP:
- Greek/scientific/math layer
- International layer
- Considering switching navigation layer to a vim layer
